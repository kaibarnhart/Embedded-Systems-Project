# Embedded-Systems-Project
This project implements an autonomous steering and auto-braking system using a Raspberry Pi, TFmini Lidar sensor, UART communication, and PWM-controlled servo motors. A real-time control loop processes distance data, triggers braking thresholds, and adjusts steering angles to create stable, responsive autonomous behavior.
